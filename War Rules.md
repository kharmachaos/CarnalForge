#War Rules For CarnalForge
 
You MUST do your war attacks within **18 hours**. You will be kicked if you are unable to participate in wars of this game. Real life comes first and we all know that, but if you cannot give us lead time to prepare you‚Äôre not participating as a team player. **18 HOUR RULE** gives us 6 hours to track down team members and clean up on defense. You will be added to two group chats ForgedWAR and ForgedDEFENSE.  
 **Please communicate so we can help you with your war Attack** If you only have an hour before bed and you won‚Äôt be online at the 18 hour team goal, let us know and we will take care of you and insure you get your time to annihilate the competition. It is more important to complete your war Attack within the 18 Hour Rule than to wait because you cannot hang in the Defense room.

1. Stage One: **DEFENSE** First Hour of War we focus on Defense. **EVERYONE LOG SOME TIME IN DEFENSE CHAT**
    * Report To ForgedDEFENSE Chat Room  20 Minutes before war if you‚Äôre available to defend... 
    *  **Top Bases To Defend: Killer, Kharma, Dynesta, Banner 1-3**
    * This allows us to rack up defense points 
    * **IF YOU ONLY HAVE 20 MINUTES TO DEFEND** IT‚ÄôS OKAY, just let DEFENSE CHAT know when you are logging off
    * The Goal is to always have members from the team **SHIFT IN** on war days  
    * **Always** log some time in the Defense Chat when wars are happening 
    * If a Team is not online for the most part, we will amend when WAR WAVES are scheduled for that team  
     **PLEASE READ ForgedDEFENSE DETAILS WIKI SUBPAGE BELOW**

 2. Stage Two: **ATTACKS** We begin our **FIRST WAVE** War Attacks the **2nd HOUR OF WAR**. An officer will call **ROLL CALL** to see who‚Äôs online and available to help with the First Wave, **Report To ForgedWAR Chat** with ‚ÄúH‚Äù or ‚ÄúHere‚Äù. The War Lead will pair you up and when ready will shoutout KILL/GO. **WAVE ATTACKS HAPPEN EVERY OTHER HOUR.** Diluting defenders is key when taking down biggest targets, when I need multiple wars we all hit One team at the same time.
    * **IF YOU ONLY HAVE 20 MINUTES TO DO YOUR WAR ATTACK IN THAT 18 HOUR PERIOD** ITS OKAY, just let an OFFICER know and we will get you taken care of.
    * If you don‚Äôt have a target list in email, Backer that‚Äôs assigned to you will call your target
    * **ALWAYS** ask for backup in ForgedWAR Chat **AND GET CONFIRMATION** before you fly
    * **Doing War Attacks every other hour helps players in different time zones** plan their attacks in their real lives. Hr 23, 21, 19 etc will be best hope for diluting defenders.

#ForgedDEFENSE - War Defense Chat 
1. Multiple wars can clog up Team Chat. When teams start attacking it‚Äôs easier to be assigned which incoming attacks to defend. It makes sense to defend the strongest bases, if it‚Äôs possible to get 3 defenders on the team protecting our strongest bases it has a higher chance of preventing 250 üî• on War. This is what we want.

    * Report here 20 Minutes before war if online to state if you are available for Defense. 
    * Report here when logging in On war days and let us know if you‚Äôre floating. 
    * **PLEASE READ ForgedDEFENSE DETAILS WIKI SUBPAGE BELOW**


#ForgedWAR - War Attack Chat
1. Multiple wars can clog up Team Chat. No matter what time you log in you can scroll through ForgedWAR chat and see if you‚Äôre flying into multiple defenders. It‚Äôs upto you to ask for support.

    * **READ YOUR EMAIL ON WAR DAYS**, ON OCCASION you will already have **PREASSIGNED WAR TARGET LIST** to minimize confusion in War Chat.
    * When you hear **ROLL CALL** come to ForgedWAR Chat and REPORT IN - TYPE 1 or 2
    * War Captain will pair you up. **1** Leader (L) or **2** Backer (B) ex. (‚Äú@DynestaForged @SkullBoneCup Paired‚Äù means Dy is **1** Skull is **2**)
    * **LEAD WILL CALL** THEIR TARGETS **IF** WAR TARGET EMAIL WAS SENT backer will be assigned accordingly by War Master or Mistress
    * IF NO EMAIL **WAR Master/Mistress** will PAIR YOU in ForgedWAR Chat so other players aren‚Äôt also attacking the same base. 
    * **LEADS, find your lead a target immediately after paired** this will get the wave rolling faster. **Type ‚ÄúR‚Äù when Ready**
    * **Always** wait for War Lead  to count down **GO** **KILL** before you run you‚Äôre target with your Backing support. EVERYONE FLYING AT ONCE MAKES AN EFFECTIVE WAVE ATTACK
    * **PAIR** reports in ForgedWAR after war run to report outcome
    * **IF** your war run got less than 5üî• another backer can be assigned by War Lead, or decoy runs can be coordinated for you
    * **BACKER BECOMES LEAD** unless Lead is smaller level, **WAR LEAD** picks up Backing when possible, SMALLER PLAYER is to report to ForgedDEFENSE  
    * **PAIR** declares run result in War Chat; # of üî•, and # of defenders (i.e. 5 flames, 0 def or 3üî•, 2 def).
